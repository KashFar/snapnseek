## Snap N Seek

Geocaching but With Pictures
 
A live website built with React-Redux where you can play a geocaching game with your friends. Register on the website and find cool or hard to find place to snap pictures of in the city. Then you create a Target by uploading a picture with a  description and select one of four sections of the city where the picture was taken. Now anyone can look at your Target on the site and then try to replicate your picture from the same location. Location data of your guess is compared to that of the original Target.


Users can have fun trying to find cool things around the city and get points for guessing on targets. Users with the highest point totals are listed on the leaderboard.
